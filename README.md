# Guide
1. Download and unzip the repo

4. Go to your User folder
```
Default User Locations:
Windows:  C:\Users\UserName\Documents\Dolphin Emulator
macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Dolphin
Linux: ~/.dolphin-emu

If Portable.txt Exists: *Dolphin Installation Location*/User
```
5. Navigate to /Load/Textures and create a folder with the name 'GHQ'
6. Copy the 4 folders from your chosen controller layout and paste that within the GHQ folder

That's it! Anytime you want to change a controller layout, simply copy and paste into the GHQ folder
